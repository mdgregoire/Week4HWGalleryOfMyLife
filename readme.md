To start run :  npm install
This should install: express, body-parser, pg, and bootstrap.

Next you will have to create a database named: gallery_images

In the database.sql file there are 2 create table queries that will need to be ran
in order for the app to function properly.

I've included an insert query as well if you want to populate the db with some pictures.
The insert is not needed for the db to work however.
